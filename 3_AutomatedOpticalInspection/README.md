# Object Segmentation and Detection

## Step 
1. Pre Process
2. Segmentation

## Pre Process
a) Noise Removal.\
b) Light Removal.\
c) Binarization.

## Segmentation
In the segmentation step, we are going to use two different algorithms\
a) Contour detection\
b) Connected components extraction (labeling)
